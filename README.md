# Algorithms Visualizer Jigsaw

## Introduction

I wanted to find a way to see how sorting algorithms work in a visual way, something that would make the process more engaging and interactive. That's when the idea for Algorithms Visualizer Jigsaw struck me!

This app uses a classic jigsaw puzzle mechanic to bring sorting algorithms to life. By manipulating puzzle pieces, you can see how different sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort work step-by-step. It's a fun and effective way to gain a deeper understanding of how these algorithms function.

## Features

Visualize three sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort.

More algorithms to be added in future updates.

Interactive jigsaw puzzle interface makes learning fun and engaging.
Simple and intuitive design.
